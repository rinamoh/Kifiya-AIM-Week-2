# Week 2 Challenge: Customer Experience Analytics for Fintech Apps
## Task 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Scraped 1,200+ reviews from Google Play Store for Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), Bank of Abyssinia (BOA), and Dashen Bank.
- Preprocessed data: removed duplicates, handled missing values, normalized dates to YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Raw data saved in `data/reviews.csv`, cleaned data in `data/clean_reviews.csv`.
- Used `google-play-scraper` for scraping and `pandas` for preprocessing.
